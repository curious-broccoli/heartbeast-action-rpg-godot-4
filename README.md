# heartbeast-action-rpg-godot-4

I implemented the [Action RPG tutorial by HeartBeast](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL9FzW-m48fn2SlrW0KoLT4n5egNdX-W9a) in Godot 4.1 

## Notes

* I was testing some stuff and turned off or changed collision settings for the cliff tile map, so some of them currently have no collision with the player.
* The player seems to start with the hit effect shader turned on, that is why he looks so weird. I might fix that at some point.
* Some parts are likely different from the video.
* The folder with the assets might be duplicated and in a weird place.
